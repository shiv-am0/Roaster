## About The App
Roaster is a sleep-breaking alarm app which plays an audio in loop which is only stopped when user answers a randomly provided question correctly. The user sets an 
alarm using the Material Time Picker and when the alarm is invoked, the user is provided with a random question which when answered correctly stops the alarm.
